    "## 1. Creating Arrays by Importing Numpy Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `import numpy as np` to import the NumPy library for array operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Attributes of Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes such as `dtype`, `ndim`, `shape`, and `size` help you discover information about an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `integers.ndim` gives the number of dimensions.\n",
    "  - `integers.shape` gives the shape.\n",
    "  - `integers.size` gives the total number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Filling Arrays with Specific Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fill arrays with specific values using functions like `zeros()`, `ones()`, and `full()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `np.zeros(5)` creates an array of 5 zeros.\n",
    "  - `np.ones(3)` creates an array of 3 ones.\n",
    "  - `np.full(4, 7)` creates an array of 4 sevens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Creating Arrays from Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `np.arange()` for integer ranges and `np.linspace()` for evenly spaced floating-point ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - `np.arange(5)` creates: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "  - `np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, num=5)` creates: `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Reshaping Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.reshape()` method allows you to change an array's dimensions, as long as the total number of elements remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `np.arange(1, 21).reshape(4, 5)` reshapes a 1D array into a 2D array with 4 rows and 5 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Displaying Large Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "- When displaying arrays with 1000+ elements, NumPy truncates the output and omits middle rows or columns for easier readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. List vs. Array Performance (Using `%timeit`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Array operations** are much faster than equivalent list operations.\n",
    "- Use the `%timeit` magic command in IPython or Jupyter to time operations.\n",
    "  - Magics are special commands in IPython and Jupyter Notebooks, starting with `%` (line magics) or `%%` (cell magics), that provide additional functionality like timing code execution with `%timeit`.\n",
    "  - Other magics: `%load`, `%save`, `%run`, `%precision`, `%cd`, `%edit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Array Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform element-wise operations like arithmetic between arrays and scalars or between arrays of the same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `number * 2` or `number ** 3` applies the operation to each element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Broadcasting allows arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes, automatically adjusting smaller arrays to match the size of larger arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `numbers * [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` applies the operation to each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Array Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can compare arrays element-wise, resulting in a Boolean array indicating True or False for each comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `number >= 13` gives a Boolean array: `[True, True, True, True, True]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. NumPy Calculation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods like `.sum()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, `.mean()`, `.std()`, and `.var()` perform aggregation operations over the entire array or along specific axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Universal Functions (ufuncs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ufuncs` are element-wise functions that perform operations like `np.sqrt()`, `np.add()`, and more.\n",
    "- They also support broadcasting for element-wise operations across arrays of different shapes.\n",
    "NumPy universal functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Math — add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, exp, log, sqrt, power, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigonometry — sin, cos, tan, hypot, arcsin, arccos, arctan, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit manipulation — bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, invert, left_shift, and right_shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison — greater, greater_equal, less, less_equal, equal, not_equal, logical_and, logical_or, logical_xor, logical_not, minimum, maximum, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point — floor, ceil, isinf, isnan, fabs, trunc, and more.\n",

    "## 13. Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-dimensional arrays** can be indexed and sliced like lists.\n",
    "- **Two-dimensional arrays** require row and column indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - `grades[0, 1]` selects the element at row 0, column 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Views and Copies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.1 Shallow Copies (Views)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Views are shallow copies of data structures and don't have their own independent data; instead, they reference data in the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example with `numpy.view()`**:\n",
    "  - `numbers.view()` creates a view of the `numbers` array, where changes to `numbers` are reflected in the view (`numbers2`) and vice versa.\n",
    "  - Slicing also creates views. For example, `numbers[0:3]` is a view of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2 Deep Copies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Copying** is used when you need independent copies of the original data. This is critical in multi-core or parallel programming environments to prevent simultaneous modifications from corrupting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: `numpy.copy()` creates a deep copy of the array data, ensuring that changes to the original array do not affect the copied array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Reshaping and Transposing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1 Reshape vs. Resize\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reshape()` returns a view (shallow copy) of the original array with new dimensions, leaving the original array unchanged.\n",
    "- `resize()` modifies the shape of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2 Flatten vs. Ravel\n",
    "\n",
    "- `flatten()` creates a deep copy of the original array’s data.\n",
    "- `ravel()` returns a view of the original array, allowing for shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3 Transposing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transpose arrays using `.T`, which flips the rows and columns of the array.\n",
    "- `.T` returns a shallow copy of the array (view).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.4 Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hstack()` adds more columns (horizontal stacking).\n",
    "- `vstack()` adds more rows (vertical stacking).\n",

    "## 16. Pandas Series\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.1 What is a Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array, where indices can be customized (even using strings).\n",
    "- Operations like `mean`, `min`, `max`, and `standard deviation` are easily accessible for quick analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.2 Creating a Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Series can be created from a list or a single value with custom indices.\n",
    "- Series with missing values are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.3 Accessing a Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elements can be accessed using integer indices or custom string labels (if available).\n",
    "- `series.dtype` returns the data type, and `series.values` returns the underlying data array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1 What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure, similar to a table, with both row and column indices.\n",
    "- Each column in a DataFrame is a Series, and it supports missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.2 Creating a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be created from a dictionary of lists or arrays, where keys are column names and values are the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.3 Accessing DataFrame Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data can be accessed by column name (`df['ColumnName']`), or row index using `loc` (label-based) or `iloc` (integer-based).\n",
    "- Subsetting rows and columns can be done via slicing, and both `loc` and `iloc` support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18. Operations on DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1 Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can call `df.describe()` to get a summary of statistics (mean, min, max, quartiles) for numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.2 Sorting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- DataFrames can be sorted by row or column using `.sort_index()` or `.sort_values()`.\n",
    "- Sorting is available both by row index or column values, and you can sort in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.3 In-place Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting operations return a new DataFrame by default, but can be done in place using the `inplace=True` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. Advanced DataFrame Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.1 Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "- A powerful feature of pandas that allows you to filter data based on conditions. For example, you can select rows where a grade is greater than or equal to 90.\n",
    "- Multiple conditions can be combined using `&` (AND) and `|` (OR).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.2 Selecting Specific Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods like `at` and `iat` provide quick access to specific cells by row and column labels (with `at`) or integer indices (with `iat`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20. Further Operations on DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.1 Transposing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transposing a DataFrame can be done with the `.T` attribute to flip rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.2 Sorting and Subsetting\n",
    "\n",
    "- DataFrames can be sorted by values in a column or sorted by the row indices.\n",
    "- You can combine sorting with filtering to make the data more readable, especially when sorting individual tests or students' grades.\n"
