    "### Lab 3: Box Average\n",
    "- apply lab 2 on a 2D array\n",
    "- In this lab you will be moving an array or a \"box\" from the start into the end of the list. One way of seeing this is a box moving around the 2d array from the beginning of the list till the end.\n",
    "- box size 9 elements\n",
    "- Using the features provided to you by numpy and implement the logic above. You need to provide me with a pure function that only takes a 2D array as its input parameters. To get your dimensions you can use n, m = input.shape\n",
    "- ndarray as your output that is the result value\n",
    " -  your targeted dimensions need to be ((n-2)(m-2)\n",
    " -  Then within your loop you would need to slice your input array into an ndarray as you see above and use the mean method on it.\n",
    " -  Once done return the result\n",
